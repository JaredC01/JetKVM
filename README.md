# JetKVM Rackmount Solutions

### Hey all!  If you're here, you probably want a cool mounting solution for your JetKVM into a 1U rackmount form factor.  You're in luck!

**Below I've outlined options for both fully 3D-printed solutions, as well as hybrid solutions utilizing laser-cut aluminum panels paired with 3D-printed parts, and the recommendations on accompanying hardware for each.  All links are US-based, and non-affiliate links.**
